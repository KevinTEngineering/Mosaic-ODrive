# RPi_ODrive
Using RPi with ODrive v3.5 or v3.6 Motor Controller
So you decided to use ODrive, huh? Well well well do I have some info for you.

## Genreal Usage
Plug in the motor and encoder. The order of wires for the motor do not matter in terms of pure functionality. The only thing they change is the direction the motor will move first during encoder calibration. Make sure you use the correct wire order for the encoder though, since the plug order is different for the ODrive board than for other boards we use with the same encoders. Follow the instructions on the front page of the odrive docs (docs.odriverobotics.com). When implementing code into python, run
```python
import odrive
from odrive.enums import *
```
Then you will be able to connect to an ODrive using the command
```python
odrv = odrive.find_any()
```
To connect to multiple odrive boards simultaneously is a little more complicated. The easiest way is to import the ODrive_Ease_Lib file from this repo and run the ```od = find_ODrives()``` method

The easiest way to control the ODrive is though the ODrive_Ease_Lib Library, since it condenses commonly used commands into singular, short, and intuitive lines. The only major issue with this is that it can send redundant commands. This is not a problem for most situations (where very rapid updates are not required). But in situations like in the Gantry Game or the conference sand table where complex paths are determined by rapidly updating pos_setpoint, the latency can be a problem. The best way of going around this is to just use the native odrive commands where you set the axis requested state and controller control mode a singular time then during updates, only change the pos_setpoint.

## Calibrating

## Troubleshooting with ODrive!

Format:
hex - dec - meaning - info

Axis errors
0x01 - 1 - invalid state - tried to go into a state you are not allowed to. Usually you tried to do closed loop control before calibrating encoder or tried calibrating encoder before calibrating motor

0x10 - 16 - Break Resistor disarmed. Sometimes the break resistor is disconnected`

0x20, 0x40, 0x60 - 32, 64, 96 - motor not working. Sometimes its a fluke caused by messing around the odrive; fix this by rebooting the odrive. Either that or there is a wire unplugged. Or something whacky is going on that should probably be investigated.

0x100 - 256 - Encoder failure. This can have a number of causes and solutions. Check the encoder error
    Encoder errors
    
    0x02 - 2 - intended CPR not reached. Can be a few issues. Most common is that the motor needs more calibration current. This can be fixed by increasing the calibration current. I think you also need to have the current limit higher than the calibration current but im not certain about this. Next check that the cpr of the encoder is the same as the cpr expected by the odrive. Most of our encoders are 8096 cpr by default but some are 4096. The ODrive expects 8092 by default, so its usually fine. Sometimes wiring issues also cause this problem, but that is uncommon. Its also possible the encoder is kind of broken.

    0x04 - 4 - no signal from encoder. Either the encoder is not corrently wired, or the encoder is broken. Or there is something else but I haven't had this happen yet.

0x200 - 512 - Controller error - Usually the system had an overspeed error. I havent had any other controller errors. Usually overspeed errors aren't a problem so you can fix this by setting the odrv.axis.controller.config.vel_limit_tolerance to 0. This makes it not run the overspeed test. Or you could raise it to a value large enough for it not to matter, but that's only useful where a velocity limit is crucially important.


Other probelms
Sometimes communication to the ODrive cuts out - Yeah thats weird, but it happens. If you are connecting from a device through a USB Hub, sometimes this happens. Try Using a different model USB hub. This happsn often with the type the DPEA has for every surface. Sometimes the problem can be fixed with a reflash of firmware (sent through the ST Link). Also, if you are connecting to a windows computer, sometimes you have to power cycle the ODrive to make it reconnect after a reboot. Windows be whack.

Also if there are different problems, check the ODrive forums/discord. Or if that doesn't work you can send me an email at blakelazarine@dpengineering.org. I will keep notifications on for this email but if I dont reply within a couple of days Mr. Harlow and Mr. Shaeer have my phone number and could send me a text / call me.
