for all of these, a distance of 50000 counts was moved on oxis 0 of the first DPEA odrive
tester setup. All values likely change when moving different distances and on
different setups


for ax1, vel gain of 6 


for 3530 1400kv propdrive motor:
    pos gain = 20
    vel gain = 0.0003
    vel integrator gain = 0
